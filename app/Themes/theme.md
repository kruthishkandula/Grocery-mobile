Here's a concise explanation of each color type for your React Native app:

## Brand Colors

**primary** - Your main brand color used for primary buttons, active navigation items, important CTAs, and key interactive elements that drive user actions[1][6]

**secondary** - Supporting actions like Cancel/Back buttons, secondary navigation, alternative options, and less prominent interactive elements[6][1]

**accent** - Sparingly used to highlight special features, promotional badges ("New", "Sale"), notification dots, and draw attention to unique elements[5][1]

## Semantic State Colors

**success** - Green feedback for successful operations, completion checkmarks, positive status indicators, and "available/online" states[3]

**warning** - Orange/yellow alerts for cautions, pending states, time-sensitive reminders, and situations requiring user attention[3]

**error** - Red indicators for errors, form validation failures, destructive actions (delete buttons), and critical alerts[5][3]

**info** - Blue color for neutral informational messages, tooltips, help text, tips, and feature explanations[3]

## Surface/Background Colors

**surfaceBase** - Main app background, the foundation layer for all screens and root views[2][3]

**surfaceElevated** - Cards, list items, panels that sit "above" the base; in dark mode this is lighter than base to show elevation[2][3]

**surfaceOverlay** - Highest elevation elements like modals, dialogs, bottom sheets, and overlays that appear on top of everything[2]

## Border Colors

**borderDefault** - Standard borders for input fields, cards, dividers, and component outlines[3]

**borderSubtle** - Very light separation between similar elements, subtle dividers in lists, and minimal grid lines[3]

## Text/Foreground Colors

**textPrimary** - Main readable content, headings, body text, and important labels; must meet WCAG 4.5:1 contrast ratio[6][3]

**textSecondary** - Supporting information like descriptions, captions, timestamps, and metadata with reduced emphasis[6][3]

**textTertiary** - Lowest priority text like placeholders, disabled states, helper text, and subtle labels[6][3]

**textInverse** - Text that appears on colored backgrounds like button text on primary color or text on dark surfaces[2][3]

## Interactive States

**focusRing** - Blue outline for focused elements, accessibility indicators for keyboard navigation, and active form field borders[4][9]

**linkDefault** - Color for clickable text links, "Learn more" links, and navigation links within content[4][6]
